# Clock Picker in Flutter

## Background

Until the last moment, I was 100% sure that there was a library on pub.dev for Flutter that would allow us to implement this functionality. Unfortunately, that was not the case.

If you ask ChatGPT for help, you will only get the names of non-existent libraries.

So, the only option was to implement it myself.

I hope this code helps you accomplish your task.
